$tar -xf Python-x.x.x.tgz
$cd Python-x.x.x
$./configure
$sudo make altinstall --> here altinstall is used as ubuntu system may have software  packages dependant on other version of python as well (alternatively we can use "install" but "altinstall" is prefered)

$pyinstaller file_name --onefile --> command creates .exe from python file, it creates 2 folders "dist" and "build" . The "dist" folder has the .exe file 


$python -m pip install package_name==1.2.3  / pip install package_name==1.2.3   --> To install specific version of a python package/
$python -m pip install "package_name>=3.2,<3.3" / pip install "package_name>=3.2,<3.3"  --> To install latest version of 3.2 but not 3.3 or 												    above. hence we define a range to download 												    software from
